.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Being a sub\-command of \fIdh\-exec\fR(1), this program must not be
ran directly, but through \fIdh\-exec\fR, which automatically runs all
available sub\-commands if run bare; or explicitly with \fBdh\-exec
\-\-with=subst\fR.

It is a wrapper around the various other filtering helpers, and will
pipe the input file through all the available filtering helpers. It is
up to these scripts to do the actual work.

.SH "SCRIPTS"

.TP
.B dh\-exec\-filter\-arch
Filters out lines that are not for the current architecture. A line
can be pre\- or post\-fixed with a bracketed list of architectures,
and it will be kept only if building on one of the architectures.

The filter supports negation and wildcards, with the same syntax as
\fIdpkg\-architecture\fR(1).

Introduced in version \fI0.13\fR.

.TP
.B dh\-exec\-filter\-build\-profiles
Filters out lines that do not match the build profiles in effect. One
can use the same syntax as in \fIdebian/control\fR files. If any of
the profiles match, the line will be kept, otherwise it gets filtered
out.

If a profile is specified, but \fBDEB_BUILD_PROFILES\fR is unset, an
error will be thrown.

Introduced in version \fI0.13\fR.

.TP
.B dh\-exec\-filter\-comments
Removes commented and empty lines.

Introduced in version \fI0.13\fR.
